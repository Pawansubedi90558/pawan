<h1>COVID-19</h1>
     <img src="under.jpeg"height="300"width="500">

	<p title="Coronavirus"><b>Coronavirus</b> disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. [1] It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. [2, 3] On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009. [4] </p>  
	
<!--Symptoms  -->

	<h2>Symptoms</h2>
	<p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.</p>

<b>Most common symptoms:</b>
<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>cough</li>
<li>tiredness</li>
<li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
<b>Less common symptoms:</b>
<li>aches and pains</li>
<li>diarrhoea</li>
<li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
<li>red or irritated eyes</li>
<b>Serious symptoms:</b>
<li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
<li>loss of speech or mobility, or confusion</li>
<li>chest pain</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diagnostic Test</h3>
<p>COVID-19 diagnostic testing is done to find out if you're currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved these types of tests for diagnosing a COVID-19 infection:</p>

<p title="Diagnostic Test"><b>RT-PCR test</b>: Also called a molecular test, this COVID-19 test detects genetic material of the virus using a lab technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A fluid sample is collected by inserting a long nasal swab (nasopharyngeal swab) into your nostril and taking fluid from the back of your nose or by using a shorter nasal swab (mid-turbinate swab) or a very short swab (anterior nares swab) to get a sample. In some cases, a long swab is inserted into the back of your throat (oropharyngeal swab), or you may spit into a tube to produce a saliva sample.</p>

<p>Results may be available in minutes if analyzed onsite or a few days — or longer in locations with test processing delays — if sent to an outside lab. RT-PCR tests are very accurate when properly performed by a health care professional, but the rapid test can miss some cases.</p>

<p><b>Antigen test</b>. This COVID-19 test detects certain proteins in the virus. Using a long nasal swab to get a fluid sample, some antigen tests can produce results in minutes. Others may be sent to a lab for analysis.</p>

<p>A positive antigen test result is considered accurate when instructions are carefully followed, but there's an increased chance of false-negative results — meaning it's possible to be infected with the virus but have a negative result. Depending on the situation, the doctor may recommend a RT-PCR test to confirm a negative antigen test result.</p>

<p>A PCR test called the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay can detect any of three viruses at the same time: the COVID-19 virus, influenza A and influenza B (flu). Only a single sample is needed to check for all three viruses, and this could be helpful during the flu season. But a negative result does not rule out the possibility of any of these infections. So the diagnostic process may include more steps, depending on symptoms, possible exposures and your doctor's clinical judgment.</p>
<p><b>Preventive Measures</b></p>
To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
<ol>
<li>Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
<li>Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
<li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
<li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
<li>Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
</ol>
