            <h1>Humanity:A Wholistic Approach </h1>
            <p>Being born as the result of combination of the genes of previously existing two male and female humans doesn't make a person human. Having a mind that can think and produce thousands of thoughts within a day can make a person different from the lower-ranked animals but not an absolute human.</p>
            <p> There are some criteria; not defined in any books or written in any constitution; which are hidden in silence within a person which when awakened turns the individual into a human. He who has a sense of what he is doing in the moment, can separate the right and wrong with the aid of his individual consciousness and has a control/mastery over his own body and mind can be in turn called as a human. The main purpose of the gift i.e. being borned as a human lies in the fact to recognize oneself as the pure witness of the world around him which even includes one's body and mind in addition to the nature and environment around him. It's like an escape from the material world without actually running from the world but like the sense of detachment from this world; enjoying this worldly pleasures and materialism for the sake of purpose of getting a running body and mind. </p>
            <p>In addition to that, growth in the different dimensions of one's life i.e. being better than who we were yesterday that in turn serves the world and people around us is in my view, a whollistic and spiritual practice in a human's life.</p>
